# gdRecover

gdRecover v3.6
=========

Used for Windows Shared Hosting to recover HARD alerting servers.

gdRecover was designed to use with a Windows 2008 (and up) Server that is unreachable via traditional RDP. The script does use PsRemote to connect to the remote server in question, and allow you to run a set of commands to asssist in the recovery of the server, and allow you to gain access via RDP by killing off select w3wp.exe and php-cgi.exe processes.

Version Information:

  3.6 : Added Variable Cleaning

  3.5 : Added password management for gdhosting

  3.1 : Removed PSEXEC and replaced with Invoke-Command.

  3.0 : Minor Changes, Added Encrypted password Support
  
  2.2 : Added an additional Paramater to specify the amount of memeory to be used when checking which procs to kill.
  
  2.0 : Base version allowed you to specify a server name to kill a pre specified list of procs against a given server.

gdRecover does this by running a TaskKill against the w3wp.exe and php-cgi.exe process's. To maintain system uptime and our provisioning system gdRecover will ignore all w3wp.exeâ€™s and php-cgi.exe procs with the users SYSTEM, LOCAL SERVICE, NETWORK SERVICE and Iusr_gridweb.
